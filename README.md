NativeAnimo is an app designed for React Native developers who want to add engaging and dynamic animations to their app interfaces. With NativeAnimo, users can access a vast library of animation source code and documentation, as well as experiment with a range of pre-built animation examples.

Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, NativeAnimo offers detailed documentation and tutorials that cover everything from the basics of animation to advanced topics like combining multiple animations and working with gesture-based animations. The app provides an easy-to-use interface that allows users to quickly browse and search through the animation library, as well as test and refine their animations in real-time.

With the upcoming addition of the NativeAnimo Playground, users will have the opportunity to create and customise their own animations and preview the results directly within the app. The Playground will offer a range of tools and features, including easing functions, timing, duration, and more.

Overall, NativeAnimo is a valuable resource for React Native developers who want to create visually stunning and engaging app interfaces with ease.
